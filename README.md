# IJSegmentClusteredNuclei
Segment nuclei in 2D images by Laplacian of Gaussian (user defined radius) and thresholding (user defined level) followed by binary watershed transform.

## Integration with NEUBIAS web-based database of bioimage analysis tools 
This workflow is described in [www.biii.eu](www.biii.eu) in [http://biii.eu/nuclei-segmentation-2d-imagej](http://biii.eu/nuclei-segmentation-2d-imagej)
